An open letter to the CVE Project and CNAs
==========================================

Security and vulnerability handling in software is of ever increasing
importance. Recent events have adversely affected many project's ability
to identify and ensure these issues are addressed in a timely manner.
This is extremely worrying.

Most realistic ways of using CVE data involve a machine readable way of
knowing which software component is affected and which versions. Until
recently many of us were relying not on the CVE project's data but on
the NVD data that added that information.

The CVE JSON version 5 format
(https://cveproject.github.io/cve-schema/schema/v5.0/docs/) is a significant
improvement as it includes product and vendor names directly, and supports
version constraints although they are not mandatory.

We would like to ask that:

* machine readable affected version ranges become strongly encouraged
  (ideally mandatory) for new CVEs

* it becomes easy for CNAs to update older CVEs to include the machine
  readable product and vendor names and add version information

* CNAs make sure they follow the same format when entering the machine
  readable data, so that consumers can create programs handling this
  data in an unified way

Current collection forms do not require version information and the
importance of it is easily overlooked. They could warn if it isn’t present
for example.

For older CVEs in particular there is a wealth of version information in
NIST’s NVD. Finding a way to extend older CVE entries with this (and other)
information would help everyone.

Processes/tooling to easily allow CNAs to adopt enhancements to CVEs would
also encourage improving the data, ideally as easy as something like a
GitHub pull request.

We, as projects that need to respond to security issues, could all do things
in our own ways. Many of us have open source backgrounds and realise the
power of collaboration and would much prefer to work together and build
something none of us alone could achieve. We need the tools, processes
and core support from the CVE project to make it happen.

In order to show the level of support for this, this 'open letter' is being
shared around between projects and we're accepting pull requests to add
signatures from both individuals and suitable project/company representatives.
